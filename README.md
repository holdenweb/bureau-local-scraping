# bureau-local-scraping
Scraping technologies by example. Real code by geeks and journalists. Nothing too fancy.

Although this is listed as a Python repository, any language is fine as long as the
code is useful to others.

The code lives in the `src` directory, with subdirectories related to specific technologies.
Ideally the code should contain some keywords that can be extracted and used to build a simple
search engine to aid those looking for solutions to specfic types of problem. That's
likely a way down the road.

Those who just want the latest code can click the "Clone or download" button and request a
Zip file. If you want to contribute directly will need to be able to use git. If you
can't yet, it's quite acceptable (at low volume) to send code to a maintainer, who will add
it for you.

The repository also references a subsystem that will check and improve the layout of your
Python code. Those confident with Python can use it (once a little documentation has been
added) to help maintain code readability, which is extremely important for learners.
You are safe to ignore it until you feel you are ready to tackle that. Others can ensure
that your code is properly formatted.

Currently there is one maintainer, @holdenweb on the Bureau Local Slack.
